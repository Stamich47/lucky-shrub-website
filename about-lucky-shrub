Hi! We are Maria & Jason Delmonico.

Starting from a small garden shop in Tuscon, AZ we have been blessed to share our knowledge and life-long love for plants with our clients. Every project is treated with the upmost care & attention, no matter how small or how large.

From small residential gutter cleanings to giant backyard garden oases, we have been serving our community for over 30 years and look forward to serving for a long time to come! Whether you just have a question about our many flowers in the garden shop or you are a contractor looking for a commercial landscaping overhaul, give us a call or take a drive down to our shop to say 'Hello!'.
